It's a complete CRUD app that has state managed with react context and reducer, connected to it's own API to save changes and made entirely with functional components and react hooks.

### More details:

- styles made with [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/), [hero icons](https://heroicons.com/) and [hero patterns](https://heropatterns.com/)
